Create a professional, market-ready frontend-only Next.js application (version 14+ with App Router) for the AEZEN admin portal. This is the no-code admin experience for brand owners, admins, and agents to manage the AI e-commerce chatbot platform. The app should be SEO-friendly (use Next.js metadata, semantic HTML, alt texts). Use Tailwind CSS for styling, and incorporate modern libraries to make it sleek, professional, and eye-catching: Framer Motion for smooth animations (e.g., fade-ins, transitions, modals), Shadcn/UI or Radix UI for UI components (buttons, modals, dropdowns, tables), Lucide React or Heroicons for modern professional icons, React Hook Form for forms, Tanstack React Table for data tables with sorting/filtering, Chart.js or Recharts for analytics charts, and React Toastify for notifications. Theme: Modern and consistent—primary blue (#0070f3), accent purple (#7c3aed), neutral grays (#f3f4f6, #1f2937), white backgrounds with subtle gradients/shadows for depth. Use sans-serif fonts like Inter. Make it fully responsive (mobile-first), user-friendly, easy to use for customer support agents, with intuitive navigation (sidebar or top nav). No authentication or role checks—assume open access. Use dummy data (hardcoded JSON arrays/objects) to mimic backend interactions; simulate API calls with async functions returning promises that resolve to dummy data after a short delay (e.g., 500ms) to show loading states/spinners.
Structure as a multi-page app with a layout including sidebar navigation (Dashboard, Knowledge Base, Bot Builder, Integrations, Conversations/Inbox, Ticketing, CRM, Team Management, Voice Calls, Analytics, Billing, Settings). Each page should have eye-catching elements like animated headers, hover effects, and scroll-triggered animations. Include a top bar with search, notifications icon, and profile placeholder. Ensure everything is top-class: no rookie or hardcore stuff—clean, beautiful, market-ready UI with subtle animations, ample whitespace, and professional polish.
Key pages and features, aligning with AEZEN PDF (no-code training, unified inbox, ticketing, voice with emotion monitoring, CRM basics, analytics) and CX Genie features (Bot Builder for flows, Knowledge Base for training, Integrations for channels, Inbox/Conversations, Analytics, team members, AI knowledge updates, usage reports, bot templates, multi-channel like Slack/WhatsApp):

Dashboard: Overview with widgets showing key metrics (e.g., active conversations, ticket load, CSAT score) using charts/gauges. Animate on load. Mock data: { activeChats: 15, openTickets: 8, avgResponseTime: '1.2min' }.
Knowledge Base / Brand-Led Training: No-code UI to "train" AEZEN. Form to upload documents/URLs/FAQs (mock file input with preview), connect databases (mock dropdown). List of trained items with edit/delete. Use React Hook Form for validation. Mock data: array of { id: 1, type: 'FAQ', content: 'What is shipping policy?', uploadedAt: '2023-09-01' }. Simulate upload with toast success.
Bot Builder: User-friendly message flow builder (use React Flow or simple drag-drop simulation with nodes/edges). Pre-built templates (e.g., order query flow). Aligns with CX Genie bot templates. Mock flows: nodes like 'Start', 'Detect Intent', 'Respond with Product Info'.
Integrations: Page to connect channels (WhatsApp, Instagram DM, Messenger, web chat, Slack). Toggle switches for each, with mock setup forms (API keys). Show status (connected/mock). Icons for each channel.
Conversations / Unified Inbox: Mock chats from different channels (Insta, WhatsApp, etc.). List of conversations with filters (by channel, team, date) using Tanstack Table. Dummy data: array of chats like { id: 1, channel: 'WhatsApp', user: 'John Doe', lastMessage: 'Where is my order?', timestamp: '2h ago', team: 'Support' }. On click, open chat view with message history (text/voice/image mocks—use placeholders for images/voice waves). Filters implemented with dropdowns/search bar. On each chat, a "Make Ticket" button: opens modal to input ticket info (title, description, priority: high/critical/low/medium), assign agent from dropdown (mock agents: ['Agent A', 'Agent B']). On submit, add to tickets (use local state), show toast.
Ticketing: Page showing all tickets in a table (columns: ID, Title, Priority (color-coded badges: red for high/critical, yellow for medium, green for low), Assignee, Status (open/resolved), Created At). Filters by priority/status/assignee. Dummy data initially, plus dynamically added from chats. On each ticket row, a chat icon: clicking navigates to a ticket-specific chat view (mock messages). Implement full functionality with local state for creating/updating. UI: Modern cards for tickets, animated modals.
CRM: Mock page showing customers in a table (columns: Name, Order ID, Confirmation Status (confirmed/pending), Delivery Date). Search bar (filter by name/ID), date filters (dropdown for ranges like last 7 days). Use Tanstack Table for sorting/filtering. Dummy data: [{ name: 'Alice Smith', orderId: 'ORD123', status: 'Confirmed', deliveryDate: '2023-09-20' }, { name: 'Bob Johnson', orderId: 'ORD456', status: 'Pending', deliveryDate: '2023-09-25' }]. On clicking a row, open a popup modal with full info: orders list, location/address, delivery time, contact details. Modal with tabs for sections, animated entry.
Team Management: List agents/teams with roles (owner/admin/agent). Add/edit forms (mock). Mock data: [{ name: 'Alina Baber', role: 'Admin', id: '22L-7492' }]. Feature gating toggles per team.
Voice Calls: Monitoring page with mock calls list (inbound/outbound). Show sentiment (green/yellow/red badges with emotion icons). Human takeover button (toast on click). Mock data: { callId: 1, caller: 'Customer X', sentiment: 'red', duration: '5min' }.
Analytics: Dashboards with charts (resolution times, ticket loads, call sentiment trends, ROI metrics) using Recharts. Filters by date/channel. Mock data for lines/bars.
Billing: Mock subscriptions page showing tiers (Basic: $49/mo, Pro: $99/mo, Enterprise: Custom). Current plan card, usage stats. Mock data: { plan: 'Pro', conversations: 15000/30000, nextBill: '2023-10-01', amount: '$99' }. Invoice history table. No real payments.
Settings: Basic controls like language, data privacy toggles, audit logs view (mock table).

For all pages: Use dummy data to mimic backend (e.g., const mockFetch = async () => { await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 500)); return dummyData; }). Show loading skeletons. Implement search/filters with local state. Ensure omnichannel/multi-modal hints (e.g., image upload in chats). Multilingual placeholders (dropdown in settings). No real voice/image processing—use mocks
