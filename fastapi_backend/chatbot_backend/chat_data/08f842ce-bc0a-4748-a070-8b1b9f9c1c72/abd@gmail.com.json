        "answer": "GPA calculations involve two types of averages: the Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA) and the Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA). \n\nThe grade points for each letter grade are defined as follows:\n- A+ = 4.00\n- A = 4.00\n- A- = 3.67\n- B+ = 3.33\n- B = 3.00\n- B- = 2.67\n- C+ = 2.33\n- C = 2.00\n- C- = 1.67\n- D+ = 1.33\n- D = 1.00\n- F = 0.00\n\nThe SGPA is calculated using the formula:\nSGPA = (P1*C1 + P2*C2 + P3*C3 + P4*C4) / C\n\nWhere:\n- P1, P2, P3, and P4 are the grade points earned in the courses.\n- C1, C2, C3, and C4 are the credit hours of the respective courses.\n- C is the total number of credits attempted in the semester, which is calculated as C = C1 + C2 + C3 + C4.\n\nThe SGPA indicates the GPA of courses completed in a specific semester, while the CGPA provides the cumulative GPA of all courses completed by a student up to that point. \n\nIf you need further information or clarification, feel free to ask!",

        "answer": "At FAST University, students who are under academic warning or probation have specific registration requirements. \n\n1. **Courses with F Grades**: Students must register for all courses in which they received a grade of F, as long as those courses are being offered.\n\n2. **Courses with Low Passing Grades**: Students should also register for courses where they received grades of D, D+, or C-, provided that these courses are available.\n\n3. **Second Academic Warning**: If a student is on a second academic warning, they are not allowed to register for any new courses unless they receive a recommendation from the Head of Department (HoD) and obtain approval from the Controller of Examinations.\n\nIn regular fall and spring semesters, students without academic warning are expected to take courses as prescribed in the prospectus, with a normal course load of 5 courses. Final year students may register for one additional course, which can include their Final Year Project (FYP). \n\nIf you need further details, feel free to ask!",
